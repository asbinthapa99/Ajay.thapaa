This is a simple, clean, and fully responsive portfolio website I built for my brother, Ajay Thapa â€” to help him showcase his background, skills, and aspirations online.

About website.
I built this project to give my brother a digital presence â€” something he can proudly share with friends, employers, or anyone who wants to know him better.

Itâ€™s a basic static site â€” no complex frameworks just clean HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of JavaScript. Designed with love, and built to load fast and look good on any device.
